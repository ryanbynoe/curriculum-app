## Overview

This project showcases a modern CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment processes for a sample web application. It leverages industry-standard tools and practices to ensure efficient, reliable, and scalable software delivery.

## Technologies Used

- Jenkins 2.319.3: Automation server for building, testing, and deploying
- Debian 11 (Bullseye): Operating system for hosting services
- Linode: Cloud platform for running Debian instances
- Docker 20.10.12: Containerization platform for consistent environments
- GitHub: Version control and source code management

```

The pipeline consists of the following components:
1. GitHub repository for source code management
2. Jenkins server for orchestrating the CI/CD pipeline
3. Debian servers on Linode for hosting the application, database, and load balancer
4. Docker for containerizing the application and its dependencies

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cicd-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Install prerequisites:
   - Jenkins 2.319.3 or later
   - Docker 20.10.12 or later
   - Linode CLI 5.2.1 or later

3. Configure Jenkins:
   - Install required plugins: Git, Docker, Pipeline
   - Set up credentials for GitHub and Docker Hub
   - Create a new pipeline job pointing to your GitHub repository

4. Set up Linode instances:
   - Create three Linode instances running Debian 11
   - Configure security groups to allow necessary traffic

5. Configure Docker:
   - Install Docker on all Linode instances
   - Set up a private Docker registry or use Docker Hub

## Usage

To deploy the application:

1. Make changes to your code and push to GitHub
2. Jenkins will automatically trigger a new pipeline run
3. Monitor the pipeline progress in the Jenkins dashboard
4. Once deployed, access the application at `http://<load-balancer-ip>`

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Build**: 
   - Clone the repository
   - Install dependencies
   - Run unit tests
   - Build the application

2. **Test**: 
   - Run integration tests
   - Perform security scans

3. **Package**: 
   - Build Docker image
   - Push image to Docker registry

4. **Deploy**: 
   - Pull latest image on Linode instances
   - Update running containers
   - Run smoke tests

## Git Usage

Here are some common Git commands you'll use while working on this project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cicd-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```

3. Make changes and stage them:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

4. Commit your changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Add new feature: description of changes"
   ```

5. Push your branch to GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```

6. Create a pull request on GitHub to merge your changes into the main branch.

7. After your pull request is approved and merged, update your local main branch:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

8. Delete your local feature branch:
   ```
   git branch -d feature/new-feature
   ```

Remember to regularly pull changes from the main branch to keep your local repository up to date.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Application logs are centralized using ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- System monitoring is done using Prometheus and Grafana
- Alerts are configured to notify via email and Slack for critical issues

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
